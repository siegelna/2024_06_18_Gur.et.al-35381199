Single cell sorting was performed using FACSAria Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After doublets exclusion, isolated live cells were single-cell sorted into 384-well cell capture plates containing 2?L of lysis solution and barcoded poly(T) reverse-transcription (RT) primers for single-cell RNA-seq. Four empty wells were kept in each 384-well plate as a no-cell control for data analysis. Immediately after sorting, each plate was spun down to ensure cell immersion into the lysis solution, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at ?80�C until processed. Cells were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software (BD Bioscience) and FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).","Single-cell RNA-seq libraries were prepared as previously described {Jaitin, 2014}. In brief, mRNA from single cells sorted into capture plates were barcoded and converted into cDNA and then pooled using an automated pipeline. The pooled sample was linearly amplified by T7 in vitro transcription, and the resulting RNA was fragmented and converted into a sequencing-ready library by tagging the samples with pool barcodes and Illumina sequences during ligation, RT, and PCR.
